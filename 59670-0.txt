THE BOOK OF LIFE
By Upton Sinclair


CONTENTS OF _VOL_I
PAGE
Chapter I. The Nature of Life	3
    Attempts to show what we know about life; to set the
bounds of real truth as distinguished from phrases and
self-deception.
Chapter II. The Nature of Faith	8
    Attempts to show what we can prove by our reason, and
what we know intuitively; what is implied in the process

    Attempts to show that in the field to which reason applies
we are compelled to use it, and are justified in trusting it.

in which man finds himself, and how he can advance to
a securer condition.

of by the intelligence.

    Discusses automatic writing, the analysis of dreams, and
other methods by which a new universe of life has been
brought to human knowledge.
Chapter XIV. The Problem of Immortality	74
    Discusses the survival of personality from the moral point
of view: that is, have we any claim upon life, entitling
us to live forever?
Chapter XV. The Evidence for Survival	81
    Discusses the data of psychic research, and the proofs of
spiritism thus put before us.
Chapter XVI. The Powers of the Mind	91
    Sets forth the fact that knowledge is freedom and ignorance
is slavery, and what science means to the people.

preserve and develop its powers for the protection of our
lives and the lives of all men.
